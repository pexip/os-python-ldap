This is the Debian GNU/Linux package of an LDAP module for Python.

This package was put together by Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org>,
and subsequently updated by Peter Hawkins <peterh@debian.org> and
Matej Vela <vela@debian.org>.

The package was put together from source found at the home page of the
project:

    http://www.python-ldap.org/

According to the README, the following copyright notices apply:

   Different parts of python-ldap have different licenses.  See
   individual directories for their licensing. In brief, these are:

        ldif:           public domain

   Although not a condition of the licenses, I strongly urge that any
   improvements you may make be sent back to us for inclusion into 
   future versions of this package (under the same free licensing).
